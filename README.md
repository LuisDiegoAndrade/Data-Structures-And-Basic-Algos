# Data-structures-and-Algorithims
In this lab I use various sorting algorithms to sort lists, and I observe their effectiveness with respect to the size of the list. An array is created and its contents are randomly chosen from a uniform distribution with a range of 1 to 1000. The array size ranges from 30,000 to 15,000,000 where one can observe the effectiveness of the different algorithms.
